        <div class="panel">
        <P>Coming from the Covid-19 lockdown many businesses were forced to work from home 
           that entailed less meetings and supervision, from then I have had to work from home with 
           less supervision and only had to report on progress made. 
        </P>

    <button class="accordion">How do you ensure you build things that work?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <P>As stated, I adopted an approach of learn by doing. thus, for everything I have learnt so far 
            I ensure that I embark on a project that will test my knowledge of my newnly found knowledge. 
            however, not all my projects will make it to my portfolio. kindly refer to my github page for all my projects. </P>

    <button class="accordion">You said you are an auditor, why programming?</button>

        complete career change and shift completely to programming full time.
